Get your Monday started on the good foot with our [Maptime Social on Monday, April 4](http://www.meetup.com/MaptimePDX/events/229652447/). We're joining up with ORURISA's Young Professionals and GIS In Action attendees for a conference happy hour(s). Doors open at 6:30p and light snacks, pizza, and beers provided. We'll do quick round of demos and lightning talks starting around 7pm so please contact the organizer(s) if you want a time slot!

Maptime is a literally a time to chat about maps. Whether you're a beginner getting your bearings with GIS or building apps for the web, Maptime is for anyone and everyone curious about the latest in mapping technologies.
